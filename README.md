# Design Patterns with Java 8

This example is to show usages for design patterns with Java 8 [Lambdas expressions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html)  

## Creational Design Patterns

- [Factory](/src/test/java/design/pattern/java/_8/based/on/jpsoroulas/_1_creational/_1_factory/FactoryTest.java)
- Abstract Factory
- Singleton
- Prototype
- Builder
 
## Structural Design Patterns

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy
  
## Behavioral Design Patterns

- Chain Of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template
- Visitor

Few test cases are provided by original author, and time by time I will continue to enhance the examples with the test case. By execute the test case, you can follow,

```shell
mnv compile test // trigger TestNg?
```
